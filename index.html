    Emanuel Di Nardo received a Ph.D. from University of Milan in 2022 with a focus on computer vision and with a deep study in modelling neural networks for Visual Object Tracking. Actually, he is an assistant professor in Department of Science and Technologies at University of Naples Parthenope and he member of the Computational Intelligence & Smart Systems Lab. Further, he worked for many year as lecturer in the same department and as researcher consultant and engineer on Artificial Intelligence in private companies. His main interests are neural networks modelling for applications in Computer Vision. His interests, also, spread on multiple fields, from generative methodologies to building deep neuro-fuzzy architecture to application in interdisciplinary fields like Marine Engineering, Biology and Medical Applications, with a deep focus on explainable AI.
