I am a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Milan. Iâ€™m primarily interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence fields. I mainly focused on Computer Vision and Visual Object Tracking. I worked also on building new Deep Fuzzy Neural Network systems, Weather Forecasting, Naval Engineering related problems and Cancer Prediction in Bioinformatics. I also worked on Emotion Recognition from faces and speech, and on Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis. Actually, I am a lecturer at University of Naples Parthenope and I work as researcher at Unlimited Technology srl and I am focused on artificial neural network modelling, medical application of AI methodologies and Explainable AI.
