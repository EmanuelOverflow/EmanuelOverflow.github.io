Emanuel Di Nardo received a Ph.D. from University of Milan in 2022 with a focus on computer vision and with a deep study in modelling neural networks for Visual Object Tracking. He is a lecturer in Department of Science and Technologies at University of Naples Parthenope and he cooperates in teaching and research activities with the Computational Intelligence & Smart Systems Lab. Further, he works as researcher consultant on Artificial Intelligence in private companies. His main interests are neural networks modelling for applications in Computer Vision. His interests, also, spread on multiple fields, from generative methodologies to building deep neuro-fuzzy architecture to application in interdisciplinary fields like Marine Engineering, Biology and Medical Applications, with a deep focus on explainable AI. He is member of AIxIA and CVPL associations.
